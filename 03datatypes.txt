javascript   has  basically two types  of  datatype
1 primitive datatype are call by value
string 
number 
bollean
null
undefined 
Symbol  : are used as  identifiers uniqueness , immutable
bigInt : 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n

2 reference  datatype
eference data types do not return a specific value when they are declared or initialized like 
primitive data types do. Instead, when you create a reference data type variable or object, it 
essentially holds a reference to a location in memory where the actual data is stored. 
This reference is what you work with when you interact with reference data types.


typeof array is object
typeof object is object 
typeof function is function object


1 Arrays = [1,2,3,4,]
2 objects 
const person ={
    name : "gaurav"
    class : 4
}

3 function   sum = (a,b)=>{
    return a+b ;
}
